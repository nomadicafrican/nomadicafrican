## Hello Folks  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is Ammar Ali. I am a full-stack developer based in Toronto, Ontario.
The reason I love coding is because I have a passion for problem solving. I like the fact that I can think code and make it a reality. In my free time I like exploring, going to parks and museams.

Having graduated from Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp I am currently looking to hone my skills, as well as gain experiance within the field.

Currently I am working on a Instagram clone, and after that I would like to try and make an Amazon or Reddit clone as well.
